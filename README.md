## Precision Agriculture

This project aims to modernise farming with the help of an array of sensors monitoring soil health in real-Ɵme using IoT 
and displaying it on the web and app dashboards(Blynk). With the help of data science and ML algorithms, this collected 
data is used to suggest what crop should be planted and esƟmate the yield for the same. With the help of environmental 
data, it also predicts uncertain weather changes to help the farmer anƟcipate challenges and take appropriate prevenƟve 
measures.
